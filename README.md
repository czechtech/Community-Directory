# Community Directory

This is a short little utility for mapping the locations of members on the PLTW Online Community.

Only current members can use this tool, and the downloaded information only provides a link back to member profiles (which still requires being logged in to view).

The url of the GroupMembers could easily be changed to map any other course.

To use this you must have: selenium, Google Chrome, and the chromedriver.
